    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>In the book Das Kontinuum (1918), Hermann Weyl presents a coherent and sophisticated approach to analysis from a predicativist perspective. In the first chapter of (Weyl 1918), Weyl introduces a predicative concept of set, according to which sets are built ‘from the bottom up’ starting from the natural numbers.
Weyl clearly contrasts this predicative concept of set with the concept of arbitrary set, which he finds wanting, especially when working with infinite sets.
In the second chapter of Das Kontinuum, he goes on to show that large portions of 19th century analysis can be developed on the basis of his predicative concept of set.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Das Kontinuum inspired fundamental ideas in mathematical logic and beyond, such as the logical analysis of predicativity of the 1950-60’s, Solomon Feferman’s work on predicativity and Errett Bishop’s constructive mathematics.
The seeds of Das Kontinuum are already visible in the early (Weyl 1910), where Weyl, among other things, offers a clarification of Zermelo’s axiom schema of Separation.</p>

<p>In this talk, I examine Weyl’s predicative concept of set in (Weyl 1918) and discuss its origins in (Weyl 1910).</p>

    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>In standard proof theory a proof is a finite tree whose nodes are labelled by sequents and which is generated by a finite set of rules.
One such rule is the cut rule, which is a sequent calculus analogue of the well-known modus ponens rule.
As the cut rule introduces new formulas into a proof, it makes proofs non-analytic.
Therefore, much effort is devoted to show that the cut rule can be eliminated from a given calculus without changing the set of derivable sequents.
Such a cut-elimination theorem is established by showing how instances of the cut rule in a given proof can be pushed upwards until the premises of the instances are axioms.
One then shows that in this case the instances of cut can be eliminated from the proof.
However, this standard strategy does not work when one considers so-called non-wellfounded proofs, which are proofs in which some branches are allowed to be infinitely long.
Clearly, in such a setting it is not enough to simply push instances of cut upwards, as a leaf might never be reached.
In this talk I will present ongoing research on cut-elimination for non-wellfounded proofs for a fragment of the modal mu-calculus.
I will discuss the basic idea how to construct a cut-free proof from a given non-wellfounded proof and present some of the current problems of my method.</p>

    <p>Modal fixed point logics are extensions of modal logics with operators denoting least, respectively greatest, fixed points of certain positive formulas.
Logics of this kind include temporal logics, logics of common knowledge, program logics, and most famously, the modal mu-calculus.
We present a survey of deductive systems for the logic of common knowledge as a typical example of a model fixed point logic.
In particular, we present two different Hilbert-style axiomatizations and several infinitary cut-free sequent systems that are based on omega-rules.
Further, we discuss the problem of syntactic cut-elimination for common knowledge and its generalization to the modal mu-calculus.</p>

    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Strict/tolerant logic, ST, has been of considerable interest in the last few years, in part because it forces consideration of what it means for two logics to be different, or the same.  And thus, of what it means to be a logic.  The basic idea behind ST is that it evaluates the premises and the conclusions of its consequence relation differently, with the premises held to stricter standards while conclusions are treated more tolerantly.  More specifically, ST is a three-valued logic with left sides of sequents understood as if in Kleene’s Strong Three Valued Logic, and right sides as if in Priest’s Logic of Paradox.  Surprisingly, this hybrid validates the same sequents that classical logic does, though it differs from classical logic at the metaconsequence level.  A version of this result has been extended to meta, metameta , etc. consequence levels, creating a very interesting hierarchy of logics.  All this is work of others, and I will summarize it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>My contribution to the subject is to show that the original ideas behind ST are, in fact, much more general than it first seemed, and an infinite family of many valued logics have Strict/Tolerant counterparts.  Besides classical logic, this family includes both Kleene’s and Priest’s logics themselves, as well as first degree entailment.   For instance, for both the Kleene and the Priest logic, the corresponding strict/tolerant logic is six-valued, but with differing sets of strictly and tolerantly designated truth values.  There is a reverse notion, of Tolerant/Strict logics, which exist for the same structures.  And the hierarchy going through meta, metameta, \ldots consequence levels exists for the same infinite family of many valued logics.  In a similar way all this work extends to modal and quantified many valued logics. In brief, we have here a very general phenomenon.</p>

<p>I will present a sketch of the basic generalizations, of Strict/Tolerant and Tolerant/Strict, but I will not have time to discuss the hierarchies of such logics, nor will I have time to give proofs, beyond a basic sketch of the ideas involved.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Full Computation Tree Logic, commonly denoted CTL*, extends Linear Temporal Logic LTL by path quantification for reasoning about branching time.
In contrast to traditional Computation Tree Logic CTL, path quantifiers may be freely combined with temporal operators, resulting in a more expressive language.
We present a sound and complete hypersequent calculus for CTL*.
The proof system is cyclic in the sense that proofs are finite trees with back-edges.
A simple annotation mechanism on formulas provides a syntactic success condition on non-axiomatic leaves to guarantee soundness.
Completeness is established by relating cyclic proofs to a natural ill-founded sequent calculus for the logic.
This is joint work with B. Afshari and Graham E. Leigh.</p>

    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>The study of Gödel’s shorthand notebooks in the ERC project GODELIANA has revealed two main aspects of his work: First, there is behind each of his relatively few published papers an enormous amount of notes. They typically reveal how he arrived at his results, as with the incompleteness theorem. An extreme case are Gödel’s 1938 results on set theory, preceded by some 700 pages of notes never studied before. Secondly, his threshold for publishing was by 1940 so high that some two thousand pages of developments and results remained unknown. One highlight here is a series of notebooks titled “Resultate Grundlagen” in which numerous anticipations of later results in set theory are found. A second main topic are the relations between modal and intuitionistic logic. In particular, Gödel gives a syntactic translation from S4 to intuitionistic logic by methods that are readily generalizable to any decent intermediate logics. These newly discovered methods are, even by today’s standards, a clear step ahead in the study of interrelations between systems of non-classical logics.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>We describe a theory of computable functionals (TCF) which
extends Heyting’s arithmetic in all simple types by (i) adding
inductively and coinductively defined predicates, (ii) distinguishing
computationally relevant (c.r.) and non-computational (n.c.)
predicates, (iii) adding realizability predicates, and (iv) allowing
partial functionals defined by equations (possibly non-terminating,
like corecursion).  The underlying (minimal) logic has just
implication and universal quantification as primitive connectives;
existence, disjunction and conjunction are inductively defined.  The
axioms of TCF are the defining axioms for (co)inductive predicates,
bisimilarity axioms and invariance axioms stating that ‘‘to assert is
to realize’’ (Feferman 1978) for realizability-free formulas.  Using
these one can prove in TCF a soundness theorem: the term extracted
from a realizability-free proof of a formula A is a realizer of A.
TCF is implemented in the Minlog proof assistant.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Syntax and semantics, often considered as conflicting aspects of logic, have turned out to be intertwined in a methodology for generating complete proof systems for wide families of non-classical logics.  In this formal semantics, models can be considered as purely mathematical objects with  no ontological assumptions upon them. More specifically, by the “labelled formalism”, which now is a well-developed methodology, the semantics is turned into an essential component  in the syntax of logical calculi. Thus enriched, the calculi not only constitute a tool for the  automatisation of reasoning, but can also be used at the meta-level to establish general structural properties of logical systems and direct proofs of completeness up to decidability in the terminating case. The calculi, on the other hand, can be used to find simplified models through conservativity results. The method will be illustrated with  gradually generalised semantics, including topological ones such as neighbourhood semantics.</p>

    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Conservative extensions are a fundamental notion in logic. In the area of description logic, deciding whether a logical theory is a conservative extension of another theory is a fundamental reasoning problem with applications in ontology engineering tasks, such as ontology modularity, ontology reuse and ontology versioning. It has been observed in recent years that conservative extensions are decidable in many modal and description logics, given that they can often be characterized elegantly in terms of appropriate notions of bisimulations. But no work has been done for more expressive logics such as the two-variable fragment and the guarded fragment, which are considered to be generalizations of modal and description logics, and are typically used to explain their good computational behavior.<!--more--></p>

<p>In this talk, I attempt to fill this gap by considering the decidability of conservative extensions in the two-variable guarded fragment (<sc>gfo2</sc>). I will show that conservative extensions are decidable in <sc>gfo</sc>2 and that the computational complexity is 2<sc>exptime</sc>-complete. To prove these results I will rely on an automata-based approach, which consists in first giving a model-theoretic characterization of conservative extensions in terms of guarded bisimulations, to then use it as a foundation for a decision procedure based on tree automata. Since the usual notion of guarded bisimulations fail to characterize conservative extensions in <sc>gfo2</sc>, I will report on alternative model-theoretic characterizations in terms of bounded guarded bisimulations and the challenge of combining them with automata techniques.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Aristotle famously claimed that the only coherent form of infinity is potential, not actual.
However many objects there are, it is possible for there to be yet more; but it is impossible for there in fact to be infinitely many objects.
Although this view was superseded by Cantor’s transfinite set theory, even Cantor regarded the collection of all sets as “unfinished” or incapable of “being together”.
In recent years, there has been a revival of interest in potentialist approaches to the philosophy and foundations of mathematics.
The lecture provides a survey of such approaches, covering both technical results and associated philosophical views, as these emerge both in published work and in work in progress.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>In constructive type theory and explicit mathematics, the idea of universes has been used to strengthen the expressive power or the proof-theoretic strength of a given system. 
Similarly, Cantini (1996) and Kahle (2003) introduced universes for axiomatic truth theories over TON (total applicative theory). 
Set-theoretic universes are usually large sets that are closed under several operations like complements, whereas truth-theoretic universes can be seen as quasi-truth predicates which satisfy some axioms for the truth predicate. 
Cantini and Kahle then showed that by adding the axiom assuring the existence of universes, several truth theories become proof-theoretically stronger.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In this talk, I will formulate the theory VFU, an extension of Cantini’s supervaluational truth theory VF (cf. Kahle, 2002) with the universe-generating axiom, and then prove that VFU has the same proof-theoretic strength as KPi (Kripke-Platek set theory with the recursively inaccessible universe) and T0 (Feferman’s explicit mathematics with the inductive generation axiom). 
To determine the lower bound, I show that T0 is relatively interpretable in VFU. 
As for the upper bound, I give a truth-as-provability interpretation for VFU, where the truth predicate is understood as the provability in a certain infinite derivation system. 
As this is formalisable in KPi, a relative interpretation of VFU in KPi is obtained. 
Therefore, all the three systems are proof-theoretically equivalent. 
Finally, I would like to mention the possibility of constructing natural numbers in VFU.</p>

    <p>What is a Gödel sentence? Is there such a thing as the Gödel sentence of a given theory?</p>

<p>Lajevardi and Salehi, in a short paper from last year, argue against the use of the definite article in the expression ‘the Gödel sentence’, by claiming that any unsound theory has Gödelian sentences with different truth values. We show that the two theorems of their paper are special cases (modulo Löb’s theorem and the first incompleteness theorem) of general observations pertaining to fixed points of any formula, and argue that the false sentences of Lajevardi and Salehi are in fact not Gödel sentences. We conclude with a discussion of the roles played by soundness and truth in drawing further consequences from the incompleteness theorems.</p>

In contrast to Turing’s, Feferman’s proof is very complicated, involving several cunning applications of self-reference via the recursion theorem.

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>I present an untyped theory of knowledge and truth that solves the knower paradoxes of Kaplan and Montague from the 1960’s. The underlying idea is (1) to formalize the principle of veracity (that whatever is known is true) more precisely, and (2) to embrace self-reference in the spirit of the Friedman-Sheard theory of truth and its associated revision semantics. It turns out that this facilitates expedient reasoning with common-knowledge predicates defined by self-referential formulas obtained by Gödel diagonalization. Moreover, the revision semantics is generalized to accommodate my theory. Apart from answering questions of consistency, this opens up for philosophical insights on the meaning of sentences involving iterations of knowledge and truth, such as ‘“Kim knows A” is true’ and ‘Kim knows “Kim knows A”’.</p>

    <p>Description Logics (DLs) are a family of knowledge representation languages, used to reason with information sets in a structured and well-understood way.
They play a big role in any field using large amounts of data, e.g. artificial intelligence, databases, and they are of importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web.
A common battle in the world of DLs is the one between expressivity, where we add fixpoints, inverses, role restrictions, etc, to a standard DL, and decidability.
That is why more expressive as well as light-weight DLs are considered, which both benefit from different derivation system.
In this talk I will first give an introduction on the general area of Description Logic, and then focus on the different reasoning problems and how they are solved proof-theoretically.
The main result will be on Martin Hofmann’s paper, presenting the sequent calculus for the light description logic EL with the fixpoint extension, and see how cyclic proofs are used in this context.

This practice blends with inference patterns in ‘grassroots mathematics’ such as pigeon-hole principles.
Our topic is this cooperation of logic and counting on a par, studied with small systems and gradually moving upward.
<!--more-->
We start with monadic first-order logic with counting.
We provide normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical notions are definable, and conversely, discuss which logical notions and reasoning principles can be defined out of arithmetical ones.
Next we study a series of strengthenings in the same style, including second-order versions, systems with multiple counting, and a new modal logic with counting.
As a complement to our fragment approach, we also discuss another way of controlling complexity: changing the semantics of counting to reason about ‘mass’ or other aggregating notions than cardinalities.
Finally, we return to the basic reasoning practices that lie embedded in natural language, confronting our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary, monotonicity reasoning, and procedural semantics via semantic automata.
We conclude with some pointers to further entanglements of logic and counting in the metamathematics of formal systems, the philosophy of logic, and cognitive psychology.

The soundness of such systems is commonly ensured by only considering those cyclic derivations as proofs which satisfy a so-called global trace condition.<!--more--></p>

<p>In this talk, I will present a category theoretical notion, the trace category, which generalizes the trace condition of many cyclic proof systems. Indeed, a handful of different trace categories are sufficient to capture the trace conditions of all cyclic proof systems from the literature I have examined so far. The arising abstract notion of cyclic proof allows for the derivation of generalized renditions of standard results of cyclic proof theory, such as the decidability of proof-checking and the regularizability of certain non-wellfounded proofs. It also opens the door to broader inquiries into the structural properties of trace condition based cyclic and non-wellfounded proof systems, some of which I will touch on in this talk, time permitting.

Gärdenfors (2019, 2020) argues that humans make sense of domains by appealing to  various types of invariances in sensory signals. In this talk, I present work by Quinon and Gärdenfors (manuscript) in which the aim is to extend the analysis in terms of invariances to the domain of numbers. We focus on several perspectives relating invariances: cognitive modeling, formal mathematical and experimental. <!--more--></p>

<p>As theoretical background, we assume that numbers are properties of collections (Simons 1982, 2007, 2011; Johansson 2015; Angere 2014). We observe that the domain of number is determined by two types of invariances. First, the concept of collection itself depends on being invariant under the location of its objects. Second, the determinant invariance of the domain of number is the fungibility of objects: If an object in a collection is exchanged for another object, the collection will still contain the same number of objects. Fungibility will be shown to be closely related to one-to-one correspondences.</p>

<p>We first introduce the concept of a collection and show how it differs from the concept of a set. Then we present the invariance of location of objects that applies to collections and we introduce fungibility as a second type of invariance. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by empirical material from experiments of developmental psychologists.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Team semantics is, when compared to standard Tarskian semantics, a more
expressive framework that can be used to express logical connectives,
operations and atoms that can’t be expressed in Tarskian semantics. This
includes branching quantifiers, notions of dependence and independence, trace
quantification in linear-time temporal logic (LTL), and probabilistic notions
from quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Team semantics is based on the same notion of structure as Tarskian semantics,
but instead of a single assignment satisfying a formula (or not), in team
semantics a set, or a <em>team</em>, of assignments satisfies a formula (or not). In
other words, the semantic value of a formula is lifted from a set of
assignments (those that satisfy the formula) to a set of teams of
assignments. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>In almost all (with only one exception that I’m aware of) logical systems
based on team semantics this lifting operation is the power set operation,
and as a result the set of teams satisfying a formula is closed downwards.
This is often taken as a basic and foundational principle of team
semantics.</p>

<p>In this talk I will discuss this principle and present some ideas on why, or
why not, the power set operation is the most natural lift operation. By using
other lift operations we can get a more powerful semantics, but, it seems,
also a more complicated one.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Semiring semantics of logical formulae generalises the classical Boolean semantics by permitting multiple truth values from certain semirings. In the classical Boolean semantics, a model of a formula assigns to each (instantiated) literal a Boolean value.
K-interpretations, for a semiring K, generalize this by assigning to each such literal a value from K. We then interpret 0 as false and
all other semiring values as nuances of true, which provide additional information, depending on the semiring:
For example, the Boolean semiring over {0,1} corresponds classical semantics, the Viterbi-semiring can model confidence scores,
the tropical semiring is used for cost analysis, and min-max-semirings (A, max, min, a, b) for a totally ordered set
(A,&lt;) can model different access levels. Most importantly, semirings of polynomials, such as N[X], allow us to track certain literals by mapping them
to different indeterminates. The overall value of the formula is then a polynomial that describes precisely what combinations of literals prove the truth of the formula.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This can also be used for strategy analysis in games.
Evaluating formulae that define winning regions in a given game in an appropriate
semiring of polynomials provides not only the Boolean information on who wins, but also tells us how they win and which strategies they might use. For this approach,
the case of Büchi games is of special interest, not only due to their practical importance, but also because it is the simplest case where
the logical definition of the winning region involves a genuine alternation of a greatest and a least fixed point.
We show that, in a precise sense, semiring semantics provide information about all absorption-dominant strategies – strategies that win with minimal effort,
and we discuss how these relate to positional and the more general persistent strategies.
This information enables further applications such as game synthesis or determining minimal modifications to the game needed to change its outcome.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>We employ the lens provided by formal truth theory to study axiomatizations of PA (Peano Arithmetic). More specifically, let EA (Elementary Arithmetic) be the fragment I∆0 + Exp of PA, and CT<sup>−</sup>[EA] be the extension of EA by the commonly studied axioms of compositional truth CT<sup>−</sup>. The truth theory delivers a natural preorder on the set of axiomatizations: an axiomatization A is greater or equal to an axiomatization B if and only if, over CT<sup>-</sup>[EA], the assertion “All axioms from A are true” implies “All axioms from B are true”. Our focus is dominantly on two types of axiomatizations, namely: (1) schematic axiomatizations that are deductively equivalent to PA, and (2) axiomatizations that are proof-theoretically equivalent to the canonical axiomatization of PA.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The first part of the talk focuses on the axiomatizations of type (1). We adapt the argument by Visser and Pakhomov (“On a question of Krajewski’s”, JSL 84(1), 2019) to show that there is no weakest axiomatization of this form (even if the axiomatizations are ordered by relative interpretability). Secondly, we sketch an argument showing that such axiomatizations with the given ordering form a countably universal partial order. This part is based on our joint work with Ali Enayat, available at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353496287_Axiomatizations_of_Peano_Arithmetic_A_truth-theoretic_view">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353496287_Axiomatizations_of_Peano_Arithmetic_A_truth-theoretic_view</a></p>

<p>In the second part of the talk we discuss axiomatizations of type (2). We narrow our attention to such axiomatizations A for which CT<sup>-</sup>[EA] + “All axioms from A are true” is a conservative extension of PA. We explain why such theories have very diverse metamathematical properties (e.g. large speed-up). To illustrate our methods we show that, with the given ordering, such axiomatizations do not form a lattice. This is a work still in progress.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Cyclic (or circular) proofs are now a common technique for demonstrating metalogical properties of systems incorporating (co)induction, including modal logics, predicate logics, type systems and algebras. Inspired by automaton theory, cyclic proofs encode a form of self-dependency of which induction/recursion comprise special cases. An overarching question of the area, the so-called ‘Brotherston-Simpson conjecture’, asks to what extent the converse holds.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In this talk I will discuss a line of work that attempts to understand the expressivity of circular reasoning via forms of proof theoretic strength. Namely, I address predicate logic in the guise of first-order arithmetic, and type systems in the guise of higher-order primitive recursion, and establish a recurring theme: circular reasoning buys precisely one level of ‘abstraction’ over inductive reasoning.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Fitch-style modal lambda calculi (Borghuis 1994; Clouston 2018) provide a solution to programming necessity modalities in a typed lambda calculus by extending the typing context with a delimiting operator (denoted by a lock). The addition of locks simplifies the formulation of typing rules for calculi that incorporate different modal axioms, but obscures weakening and substitution, and requires tedious and seemingly ad hoc syntactic lemmas to prove normalization.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In this work, we take a semantic approach to normalization, called Normalization by Evaluation (NbE) (Berger and Schwichtenberg 1991), by leveraging the possible world semantics of Fitch-style calculi. We show that NbE models can be constructed for calculi that incorporate the K, T and 4 axioms, with suitable instantiations of the frames in their possible world semantics. In addition to existing results that handle beta reduction (or computational rules), our work also considers eta expansion (or extensional equality rules).</p>

    <p>In his address to the International Congress of Mathematics in Vancouver, 1974, Harvey Friedman launched a program where the aim would be to find the minimal set of axioms needed to prove theorems of ordinary mathematics. More than often, it turned out that the axioms then would be provable from the theorems, and the subject was named Reverse Mathematics.
In this talk we will survey some of the philosophy behind, and results of, the early reverse mathematics, based on the formalisation of mathematics within second order number theory.

<p>In 2005, Ulrich Kohlenbach introduced higher order reverse mathematics, and we give a brief explanation of the what and why? of Kohlenbach’s approach.
In an ongoing project with Sam Sanders we have studied the strength of classical theorems of late 19th/early 20th century mathematics, partly within Kohlenbach’s formal typed theory and partly by their, in a generalised sense, constructive content. In the final part of the talk I will give some examples of results from this project, mainly from the perspective of higher order computability theory.

    <p>When is a property of a model a logical property?
According to the so-called Tarski-Sher criterion this is the case when the property is preserved by isomorphisms.
We relate this to the model-theoretic characteristics of abstract logics in which the model class is definable, resulting in a <em>graded</em> concept of logicality (in the terminology of Sagi’s paper “Logicality and meaning”).<!--more-->
We consider which characteristics of logics, such as variants of the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, Completeness Theorem, and absoluteness, are relevant from the logicality point of view, continuing earlier work by Bonnay, Feferman, and Sagi.
We suggest that a logic is the more logical the closer it is to first order logic, and offer a refinement of the result of McGee that logical properties of models can be expressed in <em>L</em><sub>∞∞</sub> if the expression is allowed to depend on the cardinality of the model, based on replacing <em>L</em><sub>∞∞</sub> by a “tamer” logic.

    <p>Almost exactly a thousand years ago a teenager known today as Avicenna lived in what is now Uzbekistan.
He made a resolution to teach himself Aristotelian logic, armed with an Arabic translation of Aristotle and a century-old Arabic textbook of logic.
A couple of years later, around his eighteenth birthday, he wrote a brief report of what he had learned.
<!--more-->
Six months ago I started to examine this report - I suspect I am the first logician to do that.
It contains many surprising things.
Besides introducing some new ideas that readers of Avicenna know from his later works, it also identifies some specific points of modal logic where Avicenna was sure that Aristotle had made a mistake.
People had criticised Aristotle’s logic before, but not at these points.
At first Avicenna had no clear understanding of how to do modal logic, and it took him another thirty years to justify all the criticisms of Aristotle in his report.
But meanwhile he discovered for himself how to defend a new logic by building new foundations.
I think the logic itself is interesting, but the talk will concentrate on another aspect.
These recent discoveries mean that Avicenna is the earliest known logician who creates new logics and tells us what he is doing, and why, at each stage along the way.</p>

    <p>I will present work in progress (together with Graham Leigh) on a novel proof of the conservativity of the intuitionistic fix-point theory over Heyting arithmetic (HA), originally proved in full generality by Arai [1].
<!--more-->
We make use of the work of van den Berg and van Slooten [2] on realizability in Heyting arithmetic over Beeson’s logic of partial terms (HAP).
Let IF be the extension of Heyting arithmetic by fix-points, denoted \hat{ID}<sup>i</sup><sub>1</sub> in the literature.
The proof is divided into four parts:
First we extend the inclusion of HA into HAP to IF into a similar theory IFP in the logic of partial terms.
We then show that every theorem of this theory provably has a realizer in the theory IFP(Λ) of fix-points for almost negative operator forms only.
Constructing a hierarchy stratifying the class of almost negative formulae and partial truth predicates for this hierarchy, we use Gödel’s diagonal lemma to show IFP(Λ) is interpretable in HAP.
Finally we use use the result of [2] that adding the schema of “self-realizability” for arithmetic formulae to HAP is conservative over HA.
The result generalises the work presented at my half-time seminar 2020-08-28.</p>

    <p>Focusing is a general technique for syntactically compartmentalising the non-deterministic choices in a proof system, which not only improves proof search but also has the representational benefit of distilling sequent proofs into synthetic normal forms.
<!--more-->
However, since focusing was traditionally specified as a restriction of the sequent calculus, the technique had not been transferred to logics that lack a (shallow) sequent presentation, as is the case for some modal or substructural logics.</p>

<p>With K. Chaudhuri and L. Straßburger, we extended the focusing technique to nested sequents, a generalisation of ordinary sequents, which allows us to capture all the logics of the classical and intuitionistic S5 cube in a modular fashion. This relied on an adequate polarisation of the syntax and an internal cut-elimination procedure for the focused system which in turn is used to show its completeness.</p>

<p>Recently, with A. Gheorghiu, we applied a similar method to the logic of Bunched Implications (BI), a substructural logic that freely combines intuitionistic logic and multiplicative linear logic. For this we had first to reformulate the traditional bunched calculus for BI using nested sequents, followed again by a polarised and focused variant that we show is sound and complete via a cut-elimination argument.</p>

<!--more-->
Examples of semantic concepts available in team semantics but not in traditional Tarskian semantics are the concepts of dependence and independence.
Dependence logic is an extension of first-order logic based on team semantics.
It has emerged that teams appear naturally in several areas of sciences and humanities, which has made it possible to apply dependence logic and its variants to these areas.
In my talk I will give a quick introduction to the basic ideas of team semantics and dependence logic as well as an overview of some new developments, such as quantitative analysis of team properties, a framework for a multiverse approach to set theory, and probabilistic independence logic inspired by the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>In the field of axiomatic theories of truth, conservativity properties of theories are much investigated.
Conservativity can be used to argue that, despite the well-known undefinability of truth, there is a sense in which a primitive truth predicate can be reduced to the resources of an underlying mathematical theory that provides basic syntactic structure to truth ascriptions.
<!--more-->
Conservativity is typically proved model-theoretically, or proof-theoretically via the elimination of cuts on formulae containing truth (Tr-cuts). 
The original Tr-cut-elimination argument for the theory of Tarskian, compositional truth CT[B] by Halbach is not conclusive. 
This strategy has been corrected by Graham Leigh: Leigh supplemented Halbach’s strategy with the machinery of approximations (introduced by Kotlarski, Krajewski and Lachlan in the context of their M-Logic). 
In the talk we investigate a different, and arguably simpler way of supplementing Halbach’s original strategy. 
It is based on an adaptation of the Takeuti/Buss free-cut elimination strategy for first-order logic to the richer truth-theoretic context. 
If successful, the strategy promises to generalize to the type-free setting in a straightforward way.

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>An account of inferences should take into account not only inferences from established premisses but also inferences made under assumptions.
This makes it necessary to consider arguments, chains of inferences in which assumptions and variables may become bound.
<!--more-->
An argument is valid when all its inferences are valid, and it then amounts to a proof in case it has no unbound assumptions or variables.
The validity of an inference – not to confuse with the conclusion being a logical consequence of the premisses – seems in turn best explained in terms of proofs.
This means that the concepts of valid inference and valid argument depend on each other and cannot be defined independently but have to be described by principles that state how they are related.
A number of such principles will be proposed.
It is conjectured that inferences that can be expressed in the language of first order intuitionistic predicate logic and are implied to be valid by these principles are all provable in that logic.</p>

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>Conditional perfection is the phenomenon in which conditionals are strengthened to biconditionals.
In some contexts, “If A, B” is understood as if it meant “A if and only if B.” I’ll present and discuss a series of experiments designed to test one of the most promising pragmatic accounts of conditional perfection.
<!--more-->
This is the idea that conditional perfection is a form of exhaustification, triggered by a question that the conditional answers.
If a speaker is asked how B comes about, then the answer “If A, B” is interpreted exhaustively to meaning that A is the only way to bring about B.
Hence, “A if and only if B.” The evidence suggests that conditional perfection is a form of exhaustification, but not that it is triggered by a relationship to a salient question.

  <div class="abstract">
    <p>A cyclic proof is a, possibly infinite but, regular derivation tree in which every infinite path satisfies a certain soundness criterion, the form of which depends on the logic under study. 
Circular and, more generally, non-wellfounded derivations are not traditionally regarded as formal proofs but merely as an intermediate machinery in proof-theoretic investigations.
<!--more-->
They are, however, an important alternative to finitary proofs and in the last decade have helped break some important barriers in the proof theory of logics formalising inductive and co-inductive concepts.
In this talk we focus on cyclic proofs for modal logics, ranging from Gödel-Löb logic to more expressive languages such as the modal mu-calculus, and reflect on how they can contribute to the development of the theory of fixed point modal logic.</p>

    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>This talk is about two different generalisations of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and the (natural?) idea of trying to merge the two into a stronger result.
The first generalisation I have in mind is Feferman’s theorem on the “interpretability of inconsistency”.
This result strengthens the second incompleteness theorem, by showing that the sentence expressing that PA is inconsistent is not only consistent with PA, but even that PA + “PA is inconsistent” is interpretable in PA.
The second generalisation is due to Kripke, who showed that there is a flexible formula: a formula “whose extension as a set is left undetermined” by PA.
<!--more-->
In particular, he constructed a Σ-1 formula γ(x), such that for every Σ-1 formula σ(x), the theory PA + “γ = σ” is consistent.
This result generalises the first incompleteness theorem, since any instance of such a γ must be independent of PA.
Unfortunately, the straightforward combination of Feferman’s and Kripke’s theorems — the “interpretability of flexibility” — is a false claim.
Indeed, it is easy to show that there can be no Σ-1 formula γ such that for all Σ-1 formulae σ, the theory PA + “γ = σ” is interpretable in PA.</p>

<p>There are, however, several weaker results available, due to Enayat, Hamkins, Shavrukov, Woodin, and me.
These results either (1) relax the restriction on γ, (2) further restrict the allowed choices of σ’s, (3) strengthen the interpreting theory beyond PA, or (4) use equality modulo finite differences.
I will present these four intermediate results, along with the remaining question that they all fail to answer.
Finally, I will discuss why the known proof method does not seem to lend itself to giving a positive answer to this remaining question, as well as explain how any counterexample would have to look.</p>

    </h3>
  </header>
  <div class="abstract">
    <p>As anyone who reads the literature on bi-intuitionistic logic will know, the numerous papers by Cecylia Rauszer are foundational but confusing.
For example: these papers claim and retract various versions of the deduction theorem for bi-intuitionistic logic; they erroneously claim that the calculus is complete with respect to rooted canonical models; and they erroneously claim the admissibility of cut in her sequent calculus for this logic.
Worse, authors such as Crolard, have based some of their own foundational work on these confused and confusing results and proofs.
We trace this confusion to the axiomatic formalism of RBiInt in which Rauszer first characterized bi-intuitionistic logic and show that, as in modal logic, RBiInt can be interpreted as two different consequence relations.
We remove this ambiguity by using generalized Hilbert calculi, which are tailored to capture consequence relations.
We show that RBiInt leads to two logics, wBIL and sBIL, with different extensional and meta-level properties, and that they are, respectively, sound and strongly complete with respect to the Kripkean local and global semantic consequence relations of bi-intuitionistic logic.
Finally, we explain where they were conflated by Rauszer.</p>

    <p>An important fact about type theory, and something which is also heavily exploited in implementations, is that type checking is decidable
However, from a complexity-theoretic point of view the worst case upper bounds are quite serious: according to a result by Statman from 1979, the problem is not elementary recursive.
Recently, in the context of homotopy type theory people have started to consider a version of type theory in which all computation rules are replaced by propositional equalities.
In this talk, I will discuss this version of type theory, which one could call “objective type theory”.
In particular, I will show that if one formulates this objective type theory with sufficient care, type checking can be done in quadratic time.

We will be interested in measuring the “logical distance” between the two canonical sets of principles and determining whether each of them “determine” the other.
Working in the framework of axiomatic truth theories we shall consider various ways of formalizing the above two questions and present the current state of art.
The talk initializes the project (under the same name) which started in Warsaw at the beginning of September.

    <p>Dependence logic, proposed by Väänänen, is an elegant way of introducing dependencies between variables into the object language.
The framework of Dependence logic, so-called team semantics, has turned out to be very flexible and allows for interesting generalizations.
Instead of considering satisfaction with respect to a single assignment s, team semantics considers sets of assignments X, called teams.
While the semantics of Dependence logic is based on the principle that a formula φ is satisfied by a team X if every assignment s ∈ X satisfies φ, we will replace this principle by the following: a formula φ is satisfied by a team X if for every assignment s: s ∈ X iff s satisfies φ, replacing an implication by an equivalence.
When only first-order logic is considered nothing exciting happens, it is only when we introduce new logical operations that things start to get more exciting.</p>
