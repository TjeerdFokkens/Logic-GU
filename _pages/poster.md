If you are intrigued by logic and have a bachelor's degree in
Mathematics, Theoretical Philosophy, Computer Science or Linguistics consider
applying to the [Master in Logic at University of Gothenburg]({{mil}}).


## You should study logic iff this sentence is true.



Observe that "iff" is a short-hand for "if and only if". Let's name the
sentence $$A$$&nbsp;:

* $$A$$: "You should study logic iff this sentence is true."

Now, "this sentence" refers to the statement $$A$$ so we may rewrite $$A$$ as:

* $$A$$: "You should study logic iff $$A$$ is true."

If $$A$$ is true then "$$A$$ is true" is true and therefore "you should study
logic" is true. But even if $$A$$ is false "you should study logic" has to be
true. Let's see if we can make sense of this.

## Using propositional logic


We can divide $$A$$ into two less complex statements combined with the
operator $$\leftrightarrow$$:

* $$A$$: "You should study logic" $$\leftrightarrow$$ "$$A$$ is true."

Since $$A$$ and "$$A$$ is true" has the same truth conditions we can simplify
and rewrite it as

* $$A$$: $$B \leftrightarrow A$$

where $$B$$ is "You should study logic." As $$A$$ is the statement $$B
\leftrightarrow A$$ the proposition

*  <span>$$A \leftrightarrow (B \leftrightarrow A)$$</span>

is true (even without knowing if $$A$$ or $$B$$ are true or false.)

Propositional logic is the basic logic used to analyse complex statements in
terms of atomic statements. In this case the atomic statements are $$A$$ and
$$B$$ and these can be either true (T) or false (F):

<table>
<style>
td {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>$$A$$</th>
<th>$$B$$</th>
<th> $$B \leftrightarrow A$$ </th>
<th>$$A \leftrightarrow (B \leftrightarrow A)$$</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>T</td><td>T</td><td>T</td><td markdown="span">**T**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>T</td><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>F</td><td>T</td><td>F</td><td markdown="span">**T**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>F</td><td>F</td><td>T</td><td>F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The only two cases in which $$A \leftrightarrow (B \leftrightarrow A)$$ is
true is the first and third row. In both of these situations $$B$$ is true
(note that $$A$$ can be both true and false).

Therefore, in all circumstances $$B$$ is true and we have proved (without any
assumptions) that **you should study logic**.

## Paradoxes

By modifying the argument and replacing $$B$$ with some other statement it
seems that we can prove anything! Clearly something fishy is going on here.

The statement $$A$$ is "self referential" (it mentions itself) and uses a
"truth predicate" (it talks about truth of statements). Another such sentence
is the liar sentence:

* L: "This sentence is false."

The liar sentence is paradoxical in that we can prove that if it is true, then
it is false. And if it is false, then it is true. Thus, we can prove that it's
both true and false at the same time.
